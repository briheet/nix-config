# Dotfiles

These are all my dotfiles that are stable at the moment. \
I am using Arch with XFCE right now. \
Other dots are stable and working fine. \
Please be sure you have some basic knowledge of how things work before cloning to avoid issues.

#### WallCodeS (Wallpaper, Vscode, Scripts)
``` bash
git clone --branch wallcodes --single-branch https://github.com/briheet/dotfiles.git
```
